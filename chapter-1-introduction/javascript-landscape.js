//JavaScript and its related libraries and programs
//JavaScript conforms to the ever-evolving ECMAScript standard
  //ECMAScript 2015 is the new name for ES6
  /*this is a specification for interpreting code and languages
    like JavaScript.
    browsers use the ECMAScript standard to interpret JavaScript.
    */
  /*JQuery is a library for JavaScript functions and commands that allow
    us to to do fancy JavaScript things with less code.
    */
  //JavaScript Frameworks(libraries)
    /*AngularJS, React, Vue.js and so on are front-end application
      Frameworks(libraries) used to simplify the building of advanced
      interactive web-based applications.
      for instance, PHP generates the pages from the server and send them
      to the browsers, where as, these Frameworks run in the browsers
      and pull just the data from the server.
      These make the websites run really fast but have drawbacks when
      the JavaScript isnt working. */
    //Node.js
    /*JavaScript platform built on browser runtime environments.
    Used to run adv operations and applications on servers and
    computers using JavaScript. These tools allow us to use
    JavaScript as a server site programming language which kind
    of goes against the idea that JavaScript is something that
    runs in the browser.
